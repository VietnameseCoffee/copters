# Copters

## Background Overview

The Copters is a little javascript game similar to the infamous survival game The Helicopter Game.

This is an infinite scroller where the objective is to survive as long as possible, where the score is based on the duration of survival.

Users fly through the cave turning on the engine on and off constantly to fight the force of gravity to the ground while not trying to hit the ceiling. An audio file of an engine will play every time the player clicks to lift up the copter.

Collision logic will be based on whether or not the helicopter hit box overlaps with existing obstacles on the map.
